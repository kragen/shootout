; repeat measurements at every [testrange] value
; or just the largest? (True or False)
repeatevery = False

; how many seconds before we timeout a program?

; took less than cutoff seconds

;;; SITE SPECIFIC ====================

[dirs]

;;; THESE 7 MUST MATCH WHERE YOU INSTALLED bencher

; 1) MUST set local root
root = ~/bencher/tmp/

; 2) root for source code directories of programs that should be measured
src = ~/bencher/programs/

; 3) makefile
makefile = ~/bencher/makefiles/my.linux.Makefile

; 4) bencher
nano = ~/bencher/

; 5) if not empty, somewhere all csv summary data files should be put
dat_sweep = ~/bencher/summary/

; 6) if not empty, somewhere all source code markup should be put
code_sweep = ~/bencher/run_markup/

; 7) if not empty, somewhere all program log text files should be put
log_sweep = ~/bencher/run_logs/



[filters]

; ONLYDIRS explicitly listed are searched for source code files

onlydirs = 
 nbody
 regexdna



; ALLOW these helper file extensions to be available unchanged 
; from the working directory - they will never be measured

allow = 



; ONLY measure files with these extensions 
; if there are none, measure files with any extension not ALLOWed or IGNOREd

only = 


; IGNORE files with these extensions, if there are no ONLY extensions

ignore =
 txt


[alias]

; x=y z - additionally measure source file x with implementations y and z

python = compiledpython
perl   = compiledperl


[build]

make =
 compiledpython compiledperl



[tools]

; some of these need to be available to MAKE as well as substituted
; in commandlines, so we'll export them as shell variables


PYTHON = /usr/bin/python

JDKRUN = /usr/bin/java
JDKC = /usr/bin/javac

GCC = /usr/bin/gcc

PERL = /usr/local/bin/perl
PERLCC = /usr/local/bin/perlcc

[commandlines]

; commandlines are split on spaces, so "a b" and 'a b' will be split

; %X %T %B %I %A in commandlines are replaced like this:
;
; nbody.python-4.python %X = nbody.python-4.python
; nbody.python-4.python %T = nbody
; nbody.python-4.python %B = nbody.python-4
; nbody.python-4.python %I = 4
;
; %A = [testrange] value or 0 when the program takes input from stdin


python = $PYTHON %X %A
compiledpython = $PYTHON %B.pyo %A

perl = $PERL %X %A
compiledperl = $PERLCC %B %A

; (For multiprocessing make sure the extension is .py)
;python = $PYTHON -O %B.py %A

java = $JDKRUN $JDKFLAGS -server %T %A
javaxint = $JDKRUN $JDKFLAGS -server -Xint %T %A




;;; TEST SPECIFIC ====================

[testrange]

; One or more input values, programs will be run at least once
; with each input value replacing %A in the command line.
;
; Or when there's [testdata] for programs the input value
; makes up part of the filename - the file contents will be
; redirected to stdin.
;
; In this example, the input file for regexdna should be named
;    regexdna-input10000.txt
; and should be located in
;    bencher/tmp/regexdna

nbody = 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000
regexdna = 10000



[testdata]

knucleotide = ../knucleotide-input.txt
regexdna = ../regexdna-input.txt
revcomp = ../revcomp-input.txt



[outputcheck]

; Program output is usually checked against an "expected" output
; file. If there's no "expected" output file then the output of the
; first program measured for that test becomes the "expected" output
; - so make sure that output is correct!

; The default output check uses GNU diff.
; If GNU diff isn't found the default output check uses filecmp.cmp
;
; Other options are:
;    prevent output check, use GNU cmp, use ndiff



; prevent output being checked for the named test

notchecked =
; nbody chameneosredux


; check binary output with cmp for the named test

binarycmp =
; mandelbrot



[ndiff_outputcheck]

; check output with ndiff and these parameters for the named test

chameneosredux = -fields 2-10
nbody = -abserr 1.0e-8



; ENVIRONMENT for specific tests
; some of these need to be available to MAKE as well as substituted
; in commandlines, so we'll export them as shell variables
